A very dirty tool to chech if files have changed across time

"Add Folder" to add a new folder, "Delete Folder" to remove existant folder.

It creates a "zxFileList.txt" in base folder that stores relative file path and size, used to compare with real files to check changes.

TODO:

- Make app responsive and some error control
- Add option to open changed files double clicking in file
- Make stored path relative to app to make it really portable
- Allow option to save monitored folders saved file into user profile
- Check more stuff than file name and file size (optionally)
- Optimize modifications to zxFileList.txt.
